> In the command: git branch -v -a, the -a shows us all the branches (local and remote) and the -v gives us a short description about them.
> This shows that there is a difference between the repos. There are different in Professor Eggert's git repo and the branches show different descriptions hence the git repo under ~eggert/src/github/git is not up to date with Git's git repo.

I investigated the branches further and noticed that the latest commit for ~eggert/src/github/git is:
